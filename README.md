Read clipart from ancient Printmaster and Printshop applications
Based on format description found here: http://www.pcorner.com/list/DPGRAPH/PS-PM.ZIP/PM-PS-BS.DOC/

USAGE:
Just copy your original Printmaster / Printshop files into the Assets/ directory.
Run main Unity scene, click "export all" and you get beautiful monochrome PNGs in the Output/ directory.
For Printshop you need to modify the first few lines of ReadPrintMaster.cs slightly.
